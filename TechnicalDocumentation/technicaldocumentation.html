        <p>C++ is one of the most popular programming languages. It is used to create many programs and is mainly used in game developement </p>
        <p>C++ is an object-oriented prgamming language. It is a superset of the C Language</p>

        <p> You will need 2 things before starting to code in C++        
          <!-- what you will need to set up coding --> 
          <ol>
            <li>Text editor, to write up the code (such as Notepad++) 
            </li>

            <li>A compiler, so the computer can understand the code (such as MinGW) 
            </li>  
          </ol> 
        </p>

        <!-- additional information under title -->
        <!-- additional help to set up coding -->
        <p>Some more elements that are not needed but can help include:
          <ol>
            <li>Watching Youtube Videos on how to code in C++
            </li>

            <li>Install an IDE which can edit and compile the code together
            </li> 

            <li>Visiting <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> to keep up to date with coding
            </li>
          </ol>

        <!-- Header of section -->
        <header>Hello World</header>

        <!-- additional information under title -->
        <p>The best way to start coding is a simple "Hello World" task
        </p>

        <!-- additional help to set up coding -->
        <p>Follow the following steps to create your first code:
          <ol>
            <li>Start a new coding file, with the name <strong>helloworld.cpp</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Type out the following code: 
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <img src="code.jpg" alt="code"/>
          </p>
              
          <!-- breakdown of code --> 
          <ul> 
            <li><code>#include < iostream ></code>  that works with input and output objects and is a library that adds functionality to the C++ library. This should be included in almost every single type of project
            </li>

             <li><code>using namespace std</code>  allows us to use basic terms from the library, instead of creating our own (helps clean up the program)
            </li> 

            <li><code>int main{}</code>  creates a function, anything in the brackets will be executed in the code 
            </li> 

            <li><code>cout</code> is an object to output/print text. This is chained together with (<<) which is a way to stay that this needs to be outputted. In our example it will output "Hello World"
             </li> 

            <li> <code>return 0</code> ends the function
            </li>  
          </ul>

        <!-- Header of section -->
        <header>Variables</header>

        <!-- additional information under title -->
        <p>When declaring a variable, you must choose a specific type and give it a value. An example of the syntax can include: <code>VariableType NameOfVariable = value</code>  </p> 
        <p>Some specific types of variables can include but not limited to:  </p> 
        <ul> 
          <li> Strings</li> 
          <li> Int</li> 
          <li> Char</li> 
          <li> Bool</li>

        <p>As mentioned above, a variabele MUST have a data type. There are many different types of data types, but can be broken up into 4 main elements. 
        </p> 
        <ol> 
          <li><strong>Numeric Types: </strong> when you need to store any type of number that will be used mathmatically. </li> 
          <li><strong>Boolean: </strong> can only take values of true (which is valued at 1) or false (which is valued at 2) </li> 

          <li><strong>Characters: </strong> also known as char, this will store only one letter and has to be surrounded by quotes </li> 

          <li><strong>Strings: </strong> to store > 1 characters. This can include letters, symbols and numbers that are not used mathematically. </li>

        <header>Comments</header>

        <!-- additional information under title -->
        <p>Comments are very important in your code as they allow you to explain what the code is actually doing in simple terms. They can be single lined or multi-lined </p>
        <p><code>// This is a single lined comment</code></p> 
        <br>
